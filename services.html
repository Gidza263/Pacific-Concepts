                    <h3 class="main mb-md-5 mb-3">Full Truck Load (FTL) Transportation.</h3>
                    If you have large shipment and you need it shipped now, you need a full truckload carrier you can trust. Pacific Concepts is committed to providing the best FTL service for our customers and works hard to make this one of the fastest, most reliable shipping methods. <br> <br>
<h5> What is a Full Truckload (ie. FTL )? </h5>
As the name implies, an FTL is when a truck or intermodal container (full container load, FCL) is filled by one customer with their product. Typically, this shipment goes all to one place and is generally the most cost-effective method of shipping for larger volume shipments. With trucks able to carry in excess of 30 tonnes, Pacific Concepts has space for a wide range of products. <br> <br>
<h5> When to use Full Truckload? </h5>
When you are shipping to a high-volume location, that is typically the best time to use an FTL. Also, if your shipment has enough volume to fill a full truckload then an FTL is worth considering. <br> <br>
<h5> Benefits of Full Truckload </h5> 
One of the biggest benefits of sending an FTL is that it is not handled en route, meaning it is safer and leaves even less room for error. This adds up to it being faster as well. Also, since an FTL’s rate is based on mileage and lane use rather than shipment classification, this can be cheaper for some items.  <br> <br>

<h5> How much does it cost to ship a full truckload? </h5> 
The cost to ship a full truckload depends on some factors:

<ul>
 <li> the size of your freight shipment; </li>
 <li> the distance from pick up to delivery, destination; </li>
 <li> any special services required for a safe shipping experience </li>
</ul>  <br>

To find out just how affordable we can get you the full truckload shipping services you need, just reach out and contact us. Our experienced account manager will get you a reliable price that you can use to budget all the shipping services you require. Quote and schedule your truckload shipment Today!

<h3 class="main mb-md-5 mb-3">Less Than Truckload (LTL).</h3>

 As a top freight trucking & international shipping company, Pacific Concepts offers the ultimate in less than truckload flexibility. Our wide network of vetted carriers means we can always find a cost-effective route to get your items delivered where they need to be. With Pacific Concepts, LTLs are fast, reliable and affordable.  <br> <br>
<h5> What is a Less Than Truckload? </h5>
 An LTL is, simply, when you have product you want to ship that does not fill a full truckload. Considering that an FTL can carry in excess of 30 tonnes of freight, a LTL is often a better option for many shipments with smaller volumes. <br> <br>
<h5> When to use LTL? </h5>
 LTL shipping is great for large, bulky items that can stand up to having other items packed on top. Items that can be wrapped and palletized are also good candidates. These aren’t the only type of items but they tend to be the ones that fit the best and offer the most cost savings.  <br> <br>
<h5> Benefits of Less than Truckload </h5> 
An LTL offers you cost saving over an FTL service when what you are shipping has a less than truck load volume. With a less than truckload you take up as little or as much of a truck’s capacity as you need to and will also have the option to ship different items to multiple locations. An LTL may also be cheaper depending on where you’re shipping to.   <br> <br><br>
<h3 class="main mb-md-5 mb-3">Flatbed Transportation.</h3>

Flatbed trailer shipping is one of the most common shipping options and for good reason. This versatile, cost effective transportation is able to accommodate a wide range of goods including oversized items that are both taller and wider than standard enclosed vans can permit. As a top freight trucking & international shipping company, Pacific Concepts flatbed truck trailers are available with a variety of options that allow you to transport these larger items safely and securely. <br> <br>
<h5> Flatbed Trailer Features </h5>
Pacific Concepts offers both standard flatbed truck options that are 16 metres long.  Each flatbed trailer comes in models with customizable features such as gooseneck hitch, step deck drop, and double drop.  By choosing a step deck or double drop your Pacific Concepts flatbed truck will be able to accommodate even taller items. A gooseneck flatbed trailer gives you the flexibility you need for hauling items that need to be driven up onto the flatbed. This feature is useful on the double drop flatbed truck which is ideal for transporting vehicles that will be transported while stacked. For other overweight and overdimensional items we offer heavy duty flatbed truck trailers. These flatbed trailer trucks can handle cargo weighing over 45 tonnes. <br> <br>
<h5> Choosing Pacific Concepts Flatbed Truck Trailers </h5>
Our flatbed trailer models are built to withstand even the toughest terrain and conditions. All-aluminum construction makes our flatbed vehicles ideal for all your shipping needs. But tough construction isn’t the only reason to choose a flatbed trailer from us. We are also dedicated to providing customer service and handling that is as reliable and steadfast as our flatbed truck trailers. <br> <br> <br>
<h3 class="main mb-md-5 mb-3">Expedited Shipping.</h3>
